  <strong>Agent skill definitions for Arcanum. Markdown skills consumed by AI coding agents to perform specialized tasks.</strong>
</p>

---

## ✨ What Is This?

Skills are `SKILL.md` markdown files loaded by AI agents (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Opencode, and others) as custom instructions. Think of them as specialized rulesets that teach agents how to execute complex, multi-phase workflows with precision and clarity.

This package is the distributable catalog of production-ready skills for the Arcanum ecosystem. Each skill encodes battle-tested processes for software development phases: planning, specification, implementation, testing, review, and deployment.

## 📥 Get a Skill

Skills are installed by the **Summon** CLI — it picks the right destination
for your agent, handles the write, and keeps the install declarative.

```bash
npx @runecraft/summon install
```

See [@runecraft/summon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@runecraft/summon) for the
full reference, including the `install-commands` step that generates `/review`,
`/test`, `/ship`, etc. for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Cursor.

Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` file — the core agent instructions — and (optionally) a `references/` folder with detailed documentation for each phase. Agents load references on-demand as they execute the workflow.
